    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Italian savory crepes, known as crepelle are filled and baked in a b√©chamel sauce and traditionally served as a main dish on special occasions, including Christmas. In this version, the homemade crepes are filled with a vegetarian spinach and ricotta mixture, but you can easily vary the filling.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk 4 eggs and 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a bowl; gradually whisk flour into eggs, alternating with milk, to make a smooth batter. Whisk melted butter into batter; refrigerate at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Pour vegetable oil into a small bowl. Heat a small skillet over medium heat; brush skillet with vegetable oil using a pastry brush. Ladle in enough batter to lightly cover the bottom of the skillet, about 1/4 cup; swirl skillet to cover bottom completely. Cook crepe until it turns lightly golden brown on the bottom; flip and cook until other side has small brown spots. Repeat with remaining batter, brushing the skillet with oil as needed to prevent crepes from sticking; set cooked crepes aside between layers of waxed paper.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Lightly mix spinach, ricotta cheese, cream cheese, Parmesan cheese, parsley, green onion, onion powder, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 2 eggs in a bowl until filling is thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup marinara sauce into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Place a crepe onto a work surface and spoon about 3 tablespoons filling, or more as needed, in a line down the center of each crepe. Roll crepe over filling and set into sauce in pan; repeat with remaining crepes and filling, laying filled crepes into pan. Spread remaining marinara sauce over filled crepes. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and mozzarella cheese is melted and slightly browned, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
